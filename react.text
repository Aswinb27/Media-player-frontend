components 

   to design webpage section wise and combine them , it can be reuesd 

   reat is component based application

     it is of two type:

     1. Class based components:       
        == A class is used to generate component , the instruction of logic is inside the class

          class based is oftenly used in the early state of react

          🛑 also called  stateful components(by default all function for creating state is available )
         ========================================
     2.function based components :
        == A function is used to generate component , the instruction of logic is inside the function

          function based is used more recently 

          🛑 also called  stateless components(by default function for creating state is not availabe)

         ❌ creation of component : create a js file having a name starting with capital letter


 ✡️ react hook : it is a pre defined function and name starts with use key word

--------
 ✅Use predefind-function()

  methode of creatingb state
 ✅Use state()

 syntax for state creation
 const[statename,statevalueupdationfunction]=useState('')

      ✅ state : is used to store values (advantage: it can transfer value) we can share state to child components

     ****** To load the structure of functional  component 


               🛑 rfce (react functional componant  export )

               jsx code can be simple written inside the return statment

                return(

                    jsx code 
               )


               






      to load the structure of class  component

          🛑 rcc(react class componants) 

          jsx code has to be written inside return and render statment

          eg:  render(){

               return(

                    jsx code 
               )
          }



⭕ in react data binding is possible in only one way 

   parent to child

   in the components App.js is the parent component and others are child components

   all the other components are linked to app.js


🛑 to get data from the input box the data ,the input boxes are in the jsx format it has to convert to js format 

    to store the data in js format we use 'state'


✡️The methode used to get value from input when a function processing
